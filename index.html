		<p class="text">AAC is a nonprofit organization which connects businesses and civic groups with students in our economically challenged schools. They requested a mobile friendly web application to help companies easily record surveys whenvisiting a classroom. Resources for this addition needed to be cost effective and easy to use, even to the point of using a Google Spreadsheet as a minor database.</p>

		<p class="text">Sondr was a start up focused on linking people interested in learning new skills with locals who already have these experiences. I helped create the site from the ground up, which included financial transactions, ticket tracking, and tagging systems. Sadly, after leaving our services, the company shut down, as was their site.</p>

		<p class="text">Curnnect is a company trying to make international deliveries more affordable. To do this travelers take approved packages on flights, paying for their trip using the money earned from the packages. My main task in this project was the development of a search engine for Harmonized Serial or HS code used in tariffs and taxes. These are used to associate items to a specific code and name for the item. For example, a smartphone’s code is 85176290 and is listed as a Communication apparatus machine for the reception, conversion and transmission or regeneration of voice, images or other data, including switching and routing apparatus. This search engine system adapts so that future search results change based on past user decisions.</p>

		<p class="text">TWABEFTTOU or “This World Ain’t Big Enough for the Two of Us”, was a game developed for the Lundum Dare 38 Game jam, with a theme of “a small world” and only one weekend to complete it. My team spent the first night deciding on the game's features and what engine would be used. We decided to make a cowboy shooting game using a mechanic called one in the chamber, which only allows one shot to be made before needing to reload. This can lead to some intense standoffs. We needed to include the use of controller in the game to achieve greater aiming and fast paced game play. The Phaser engine was chosen, for many of us knew JavaScript, and the game could easily be played online without the need to download the game. I worked side by side with my team learning phaser, fixing bugs, and adding gameplay elements.</p>
